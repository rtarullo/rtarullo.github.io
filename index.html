    	<p>Sometimes I like to imagine that I am capable of making a decision and resisting the urge to constantly question it. 

The beginning of the school year was a very positive experience for me. The students that I have this year are many of the same students that I had my first year. I will never forget my first year teaching no matter how much effort I put into trying to forget about it. I could talk about the attempted pin stabbings and scissor attacks, but I would rather focus on this year.

I know what a bragging jerk I sound like when I say this, but I had a student from last year come up to me and tell me that her family celebrated the fact that her little brother was in my class this year by eating banana cake. A dessert has never caused such emotion to overtake me (aside from anytime I've eaten or deeply thought about my mom's Italian Cream Cake). In my first year of teaching, a parent was so insulting that she made me cry in front of her and her daughter's face. Last year, a parent called me asinine repeatedly. No wonder teaching seemed like something that I should sprint away from in the past. The Great Banana Cake Incident of 2015 began my potential desire to consider staying in Education.

As a teacher, I have found that the people who notice any mistake made are the same people who actively ignore any positive efforts made in the classroom. I am lucky to work in an extremely positive atmosphere this year. I asked my indescribably helpful teaching partner from last year (who is now a coordinator) for feedback on my attempt to make homework more meaningful, and he responded by celebrating my efforts in a meeting. The assistant principal sent me an encouraging email to thank me for my efforts. It was such a small gesture, but it made me remember the impact of feeling appreciated.

When I look out at the familiar faces that have haunted me in my grade three class, I notice the growth that all of us have gone through over the years. This time three years ago, I was trying to cover up the sound of myself crying in a bathroom stall. Now, I am able to laugh with my students and get them excited to talk about Math. 

These positive experiences have left me not knowing what to do at the moment. In true Rose style, I would love to massively change my career path to fit my current desires. Instead, I will just feel out options.  I am still interested in coding, but teaching seems more desirable to me. For now, I will just enjoy the positivity that is currently coming my way.</p>
